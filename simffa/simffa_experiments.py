class InterleaveAlgo(hyperopt.BanditAlgo):
    """Interleaves calls to `num_procs` independent Trials sets

    This class is implemented carefully to work around some awkwardness
    in the design of hyperopt.Trials.  The purpose of this banditalgo is to
    facilitate running several independent BanditAlgos at once.  You might
    want to do this if you are trying to compare random search to an optimized
    search for example.

    Trial documents inserted by this suggest function can be tagged with
    identifying information, but trial documents inserted in turn by the
    Bandit.evaluate() functions themselves will not be tagged, except by their
    experiment key (exp_key). So this class uses the exp_key to keep each
    experiment distinct.  Every sub_algo passed to the constructor requires a
    corresponding exp_key. If you want to get tricky, you can combine
    sub-experiments by giving them identical keys. As a consequence of this
    strategy, this class REQUIRES AN UNRESTRICTED VIEW of the trials object
    used to make suggestions, so the trials object CANNOT have an exp_key
    of its own.

    The InterleaveAlgo works on the basis of growing the sub-experiments at
    the same pace. On every call to suggest(), this function counts up the
    number of non-error jobs in each sub-experiment, and asks the sub_algo
    corresponding to the smallest sub-experiment to propose a new document.

    The InterleaveAlgo stops when all of the sub_algo.suggest methods have
    returned `hyperopt.StopExperiment`.
